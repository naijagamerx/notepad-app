# Accessibility Audit Report

## Testing Methodology
Accessibility testing was conducted using a combination of automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) and manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance Summary

| Level | Compliance | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Level A | üü° Partial | Most critical requirements met with some exceptions |
| Level AA | üü° Partial | Working toward full compliance |
| Level AAA | üî¥ Limited | Only some AAA criteria addressed |

## Key Findings

### Perceivable (WCAG 1.x)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Text Alternatives | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Improvement | Missing alt text for some UI elements |
| Time-based Media | ‚úÖ Compliant | No time-based media used |
| Adaptable | üü° Partial | Some issues with responsive views |
| Distinguishable | ‚úÖ Good | Color contrast is generally good |

### Operable (WCAG 2.x)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Keyboard Accessible | üü° Partial | Some UI elements not keyboard accessible |
| Enough Time | ‚úÖ Good | No time limits imposed |
| Seizures | ‚úÖ Good | No flashing content |
| Navigable | üü° Partial | Structure could be improved |

### Understandable (WCAG 3.x)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Readable | ‚úÖ Good | Text is generally readable |
| Predictable | ‚úÖ Good | UI behaves predictably |
| Input Assistance | üü° Partial | Some forms lack proper labels |

### Robust (WCAG 4.x)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Compatible | üü° Partial | Some ARIA issues found |

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues
1. **Modal Focus Trapping**: When modals open, focus is not properly trapped, allowing users to tab to background elements
2. **Missing Alt Text**: Several UI icons lack proper alternative text
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Some interactive elements cannot be accessed via keyboard
4. **ARIA Attributes**: Improper use of ARIA roles and attributes in some components

### Moderate Issues
1. **Focus Visibility**: Focus indicators are not always visible enough
2. **Color Contrast**: A few instances of insufficient contrast in UI elements
3. **Form Labels**: Some form fields lack proper labeling
4. **Heading Structure**: Headings are not always in a logical order

### Minor Issues
1. **Skip Links**: No skip navigation links for keyboard users
2. **Language Attribute**: Missing language attribute on HTML element
3. **Error Messages**: Some error messages are not associated with their respective inputs
4. **Touch Targets**: Some mobile touch targets are too small

## Screen Reader Testing

### NVDA (Windows)
- **Navigation**: Most content can be navigated, but some custom components are problematic
- **Announcements**: Some dynamic content changes are not announced properly
- **Forms**: Form interactions generally work well

### VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- **Navigation**: Core navigation works, but some custom UI elements are missed
- **Announcements**: Some state changes are not properly announced
- **Forms**: Label associations need improvement

## Keyboard Navigation

| Operation | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Tab Navigation | üü° Partial | Some interactive elements cannot be reached |
| Enter/Space Activation | üü° Partial | Some buttons don't respond to Enter key |
| Escape Key for Modals | üü° Partial | Not all modals can be dismissed with Escape |
| Arrow Key Navigation | üî¥ Poor | Limited support for arrow key navigation |
| Focus Management | üü° Partial | Focus is sometimes lost when UI changes |

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Focus Management**:
   - Implement proper focus trapping in modals
   - Ensure focus is properly managed after UI changes
   - Make focus indicators more visible

2. **Keyboard Accessibility**:
   - Make all interactive elements keyboard accessible
   - Implement proper activation via Enter/Space keys
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

3. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Add proper ARIA roles, states, and properties
   - Ensure dynamic content changes are announced
   - Fix improper nesting of interactive elements

### Medium Priority
1. **Alternative Text**:
   - Add descriptive alt text to all images and icons
   - Use aria-label for UI controls without visible text

2. **Form Improvements**:
   - Associate all labels with their form controls
   - Add descriptive error messages
   - Implement better form validation feedback

3. **Structure and Navigation**:
   - Implement logical heading structure
   - Add landmark regions
   - Add skip links for keyboard users

### Low Priority
1. **Color and Contrast**:
   - Review and improve color contrast throughout
   - Ensure information is not conveyed by color alone

2. **Documentation**:
   - Add accessibility statement
   - Document keyboard shortcuts
   - Provide usage instructions for assistive technology users

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Fixes**
   - Fix critical keyboard navigation issues
   - Add missing alt text to images and icons
   - Implement proper focus management in modals

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Add ARIA roles, states, and properties
   - Improve form labeling and validation
   - Enhance visible focus indicators

3. **Long-term Enhancements**
   - Implement skip links
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Create comprehensive accessibility documentation
